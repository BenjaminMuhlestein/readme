## How to Play
After you click the start button the game Begins.  
      Then youll see the Red Guy And the Dog.  
      The Goal is to beat the red guy to the end of the screen. 
      First one past all the buildings wins.

 ## Issues
 Once the button is preshed the game starts here is the  bigest isues. The finish line for the game does not work at this point in time. Because of that, both the guy and the dog go past the finish line.  I hope to get this issue resolved as soon as possible.
